# SpechtKL
_A MAGMA package for computing with the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis of Specht modules._

## Introduction

`SpechtKL` is a package for the computer-algebra programming language MAGMA, which adds a number of additional features for working with semistandard tableaux, and provides more accessibility to studying Kazhdan-Lusztig theory in Type A. The features provided in this package run parallel to results obtained in [a paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08857.pdf) by Fern Gossow (myself) and Oded Yacobi.
